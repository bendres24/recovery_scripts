# recovery_scripts
These Python scripts apply methods of statistical analysis to digital images to recover damaged content. I developed them working with ChatGPT and on a Mac using Python's IDLE Shell.

To run the scripts, make sure that the necessary python libraries are installed. I'm currently pressed for time, but I'll list those libraries for each script.

I've generated short videos for running the PCA, MNF, MAF, and ICA script:  ; and the LDA script: https://youtu.be/r3n9DJVhhH4.
Furthermore, I have a short video on how to use ImageJ to combine results into pseudocolor images to enhance visibility of damaged content: https://youtu.be/V_pTIeHbPIM .
